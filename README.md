# What is this page?
This page shows the R code for meta-analysis of spiked sediment toxicity tests with a crustacean *Hyalella azteca* and an insect *Chrionomus dilutus*. See the paper in Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management (Hiki et al., 2021, accepted; https://doi.org/10.1002/ieam.4413) for the details.
  
   
# Introduction  
**Spiked-sediment toxicity tests** with benthic organisms are effective tools to assess the potential ecological impacts of sediment-associated contaminants. Although several sediment tests have been standardized, experimental factors such as spiking methods still vary between laboratories. To identify the experimental factors that account for the greatest percentage of the variability in toxicity values (i.e., 50% lethal concentration, **LC50**), we performed a meta-analysis of published spiked-sediment toxicity tests. Here we publish the R code and data set for the meta-analysis.
